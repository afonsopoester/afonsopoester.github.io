Hello, my name is João Afonso Poester-Carvalho and I am graduated in Biological Sciences (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande - FURG). During my Graduation, I focused on Biogeography and species distribution patterns (e.g. Poester-Carvalho et al. 2023), with different taxa as study systems. I am able to use techniques such as Endemicity Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering to better understand species distribution patterns across the Neotropics. Currently, I am a Masters Student researching community ecology and ecophysiological resposes of dormant invertebrate stages.

During much of my graduation, I focused on studying programming and GIS tools to solve problems associated with my work.

RStats is one of my main interests of study. I am continuously trying to evolve my skills with Spatial Analysis and especially Statistical Analysis.

I am much interested in studying Statistical and Machine Learning Models and their applications to ecological data, especially to conservation focus.

Currently, I have been trying to develop small projects with the skills I learn, such as analysis employing various Statistical Tools.

## Skills

I am especially interested and continuously developing my skills on:

-   R Programming
    -   General data wrangling problems - I particularly like this
    
    -   General dataviz techniques (working on these in my GitHub page!)
    
    -   Quarto projects (such as this website!)
    -   Interactive reports (Reactable; Leaflet)
    -   Integration with Git and Github (version control, etc.)
    -   Deploying websites with GitHub Pages (I am currently developing a publication with a dashboard for species distribution)

-   QGIS and R map building
    -   Manipulation of spatial data in R
    -   Using the "sf" package in R

-   Statistical techniques:
    -   Inferential Analysis

    -   Simple and Multivariate Linear Models

    -   Simple and Multivariate Generalized Linear Models

    -   Multivariate Clustering and Ordination Analysis

        -   Clustering Analysis (UPGMA; WPGMA) - I mastered these techniques during my Graduation to perform Biogeographical Regionalization
        -   Dimensionality Reduction Analysis (PCA)
