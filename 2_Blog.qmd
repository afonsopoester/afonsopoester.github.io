In my GitHub pages I developed some small coding exercises. Most of these are applications of algorithms I have studied or projects from websites such as Kaggle or DataCamp. 

I structured these projects as Blog Posts, using the Quarto Blog strucure.

Mostly, these are some Data Storytelling examples!
